# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# IDE specific
/.idea

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep

/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Vite Ruby
/public/vite
/public/vite-dev
/public/vite-test

*.local
.DS_Store

# The .env file is used for both dev and test and creates more problems than it solves
.env

# .env.*.local files are where we put actual secrets we need for dev and test, so
# we really don't want this in version control
.env.*.local
